# PPL Calculations

PPL Calculations is an open-source project designed to simplify the calculation and management of weight and balance for
an aeroclub fleet. By integrating a reliable Go-based HTTP backend with a responsive HTMX frontend, the application
enables pilots to perform quick and accurate weight and balance calculations. The project aims to enhance operational
safety and efficiency within aeroclubs and welcomes community contributions.
